CSC 422 Assignment 1 Part 2
You will create a pet database program with the following operations incrementally as describe 
in the Milestones section.  You are not required to save the pet data into a file.  You must use 
appropriate design and make use of Object-Oriented Design.  See milestones.  
• Add pets o Let the user add as many pets as they want.  A pet is entered as a single line 
consisting of a name and an integer which represents the age of the pet.  The user type 
“done” to end reading.  See sample run.  
• Show pets  
o Prints a table of all pets in the database.  See below or the sample run for the 
formatting of the table.  
• Update pets o Shows the user a table of all the pets and reads the pet ID that the user 
wants to update. ID is the array index of the object.  Once the user has selected a pet by 
typing and ID, it asks the user to enter the new name and new age.  It then updates the 
actual object.  
• Search pets by name or age o Prompts the user for a name and then displays a table 
showing all pets matching the name.  The name is case insensitive.  For example, 
“boomer” will “Boomer”.  
o Prompts the user for an age and shows a table consists of pets with that age.    
• Remove a pet  
o Prompts the user for the index of the Pet to delete.
